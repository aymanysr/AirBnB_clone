AirBnB Clone Project

Project Description
Welcome to the AirBnB clone project! This project aims to build a simplified version of the popular AirBnB platform. The primary goal of this initial step is to develop a command interpreter that allows users to manage AirBnB objects. This command interpreter will be crucial for subsequent phases of the project, including HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API integration, and front-end development.

Command Interpreter Overview
The command interpreter is similar to a shell, but it is tailored for managing the objects within the AirBnB project. The key functionalities include:

Create a new object (e.g., User, Place)
Retrieve an object from a file or database
Perform operations on objects (e.g., count, compute stats)
Update attributes of an object
Destroy an object
How to Start the Command Interpreter
To start the command interpreter, follow these steps:

Clone the repository from GitHub.
Navigate to the project directory.
Run the command interpreter script.
bash
Copy code
$ git clone https://github.com/your_username/AirBnB_clone.git
$ cd AirBnB_clone
$ ./console.py
How to Use the Command Interpreter
Once the command interpreter is running, you can use the following commands:

create: Create a new object
show: Retrieve and display an object
count: Count the number of objects
update: Update the attributes of an object
destroy: Destroy an object
Refer to the help command within the interpreter for detailed information on each command.

Examples
Create a new user:

sql
Copy code
(hbnb) create User
Show details of a specific user:

sql
Copy code
(hbnb) show User 1234-5678
Count the number of places:

scss
Copy code
(hbnb) count Place
Update the name of a user:
